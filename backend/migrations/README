Database migrations live here. Use alembic to create and upgrade revisions.

Examples:
- Create initial revision: alembic revision -m "init"
- Autogenerate (if using models in future): alembic revision --autogenerate -m "change"
- Upgrade to head: alembic upgrade head
- Downgrade: alembic downgrade -1
